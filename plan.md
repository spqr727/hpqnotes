## *How can a mobile app for linguistic teaching be developed?* - Report Plan

### Introduction - 100 words (98)

I chose to develop a mobile app for my HPQ as I have a deep interest in software development and have created multiple smaller-scale computer programs and websites. I also have a strong proficiency for languages and wanted to do a project that not only would I enjoy, but would also have a practical use that perhaps in the future coould be extended beyond the scope of a HPQ. Therefore I decided to focus on Latin as the language in my app because there are not many high-quality apps available to teach Latin in contrast to modern languages.

### React Native - 50 words (49)

I started to develop my app using a framework called React Native which lets you write one set of code that can be easily distributed to both Apple and Android devices, however it became clear that user authentication would be a problem so decided not to follow this route.

### Django PWA - 90 words (87)

Therefore, I found another framework, Django, which helps with building a website and I have used it before. I thought that perhaps a website would be better, but decided to stick with my original plan for an app, by making it a Progressive Web App (PWA). This means it can be developed and hosted as a website whilst also being able to be packaged as an app in app stores, with an extra file called the manifest to detail things like the icon and the app description.

### Research - 100 words

- I used official documentation for React Native, React, Django, Heroku, etc.
- I interviewed Dr Brooks, a CHS Latin teacher, on how best to approach the teaching
- I used the Cambridge Latin Course and Latin to GCSE textbooks
- I used both Microsoft and Google information on PWAs
- I used Stack Overflow, a web forum, for little coding bugs that I needed help resolving

### Features - 60 words

- User authentication with login, logout, and signup
- Lessons view with an introduction and Chapter 1 of lessons
- Interactive, searchable dictionary for covered vocabulary
- Browser access
- Google Play Store testing build that enables app download for Android

### Feedback - 60 words

- I talked again to Dr Brooks and received the following feedback on how to improve my app, if I extend beyond a HPQ:

### Conclusion - 40 words (45)

To conclude, although my original framework did not work out, I found a different way to develop the code whilst still adhering to the creation of an app, and I also interviewed a Latin teacher who gave me advice and feedback to improve the app.
